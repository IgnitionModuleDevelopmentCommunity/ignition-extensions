# Ignition Extensions

A (hopefully) community driven Ignition module project to house utilities that are often useful, but just too niche (or
have enough footguns) to go into Ignition itself.

# Building

This project uses Gradle, and the Gradle Module Plugin. Use `./gradlew build` to assemble artifacts,
and `./gradlew zipModule` to build an unsigned module file for installation into a development gateway.

# Contribution

Contributions are welcome. This project is polyglot and set up for both Kotlin and Java. There are example utilities
written in both Kotlin and Java to extend from. Ideas for new features should start as issues for broader discussion.
